# React AI Contextual Application - Architecture Discussion Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes a brainstorming session exploring the architecture for a React library that provides AI-powered context-aware capabilities to existing applications within a monorepo.

## Core Concept
A single exportable context/provider that wraps existing applications, automatically adding AI chatbot capabilities without requiring significant integration effort. The system enables bi-directional communication between React frontend and AI/LLM backend, allowing AI to understand and interact with wrapped application components.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### State Management Approach
- **Chosen Direction**: Event-driven/callback architecture over centralized state management
- **Rationale**: Existing production components maintain their own state management
- **Pattern**: Components register capabilities with callbacks, library acts as message broker
- **Benefit**: Minimal refactoring of existing components - "Progressive Enhancement for AI"

### Design Pattern Identified
**Command Pattern Variant** with elements of Observer/Pub-Sub:
- Components register themselves + capabilities + callback handlers
- Library acts as a mediator/broker
- AI responses become "commands" that components execute
- Components maintain full autonomy while speaking a common protocol

### Registration & Lifecycle
- Components register on mount via useEffect
- Registration includes: ID (`<namespace>.<component>`), capabilities, callback functions
- UUID returned for instance identification
- Cleanup/unregister on unmount
- Graceful handling of unavailable components

### Capability System (Inspired by MCP)
**Two-tier system developed**:
- **Methods**: Capability types (e.g., `form.suggest`, `form.clear`)
- **Features**: Specific instances with their callbacks

This differs from standard MCP as it's "inverted" - UI components advertise capabilities upward to AI rather than servers advertising to clients.

### Communication Flow
1. Component registers with library (capabilities + callbacks)
2. Library maintains dynamic capability manifest
3. User interaction triggers context building from registry
4. Message sent to API with capability context
5. AI response routed through library
6. Library presents option to user
7. User acceptance triggers registered callback

## Key Innovation: VS Code Extension Analogy

The architecture mirrors VS Code + Copilot/Claude Code:

| VS Code + Copilot | Your Library |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Extension is the mediator | Context/Provider is the mediator |
| VS Code APIs are static/known | Components dynamically register |
| Extension knows editor capabilities | Library maintains capability registry |
| Bundles context from workspace | Bundles context from registered components |
| Translates AI → VS Code commands | Translates AI → Component callbacks |

**Critical Insight**: The library acts like a VS Code extension - it mediates between AI and UI components, maintaining a registry of what's possible and translating between them. The key innovation is making this capability system dynamic through component registration rather than static.

## Validation
This approach:
- Follows proven patterns from successful tools (VS Code extensions)
- Solves the dynamic UI problem elegantly
- Preserves component autonomy (crucial for retrofitting)
- Enables bidirectional orchestration between AI and UI

## Next Considerations
- Correlation mechanisms for request/response matching
- Handling multiple instances of same component type
- Capability discovery and metadata
- Error handling and graceful degradation
- Building the actual routing/middleware layer

## Summary
The architecture is converging on a mediated command pattern where components progressively enhance themselves by registering with an AI-aware context. This pattern is validated by similar successful implementations in developer tools, with the key innovation being dynamic capability registration for UI components.

## Core Parts Needed
1. Registry Manager

Maintains the dynamic list of registered components
Stores: component IDs, capabilities, callbacks, metadata
Handles registration/unregistration lifecycle
Provides query methods: "what's available?", "who handles form.suggest?"

2. Capability Aggregator

Compiles current system capabilities from all registered components
Deduplicates and organizes methods (form.suggest appears once even if multiple forms registered)
Maintains the "methods" list and "features" mapping
Provides capability manifest for API communication

3. Communication Layer

WebSocket/SSE connection management
Message serialization/deserialization (JSON-RPC format?)
Request/response correlation tracking
Connection retry logic and error handling
Queuing for messages awaiting component registration

4. Message Router/Dispatcher

Parses incoming AI responses
Matches responses to registered components via correlation IDs
Orchestrates multi-step operations
Handles routing to either UI components or registered callbacks

5. UI Components (Chatbot Implementation)

ChatbotContainer, FAB, MessageDisplay, InputControls
Rich controls for user confirmation/actions
Should register itself using the same pattern as external components

6. Context Provider

Exposes registration/unregistration methods
Provides communication methods (sendMessage, etc.)
Manages overall library state (what's open/closed)
Wraps the consuming application

7. Command Executor

Interprets AI responses as executable commands
Manages user confirmation flow ("Would you like me to fill the form?")
Executes callbacks with proper error handling
Handles command queuing/sequencing
